For the source bodies of texts we went with the complete collection of Shakespeare's plays except for one of his plays to use as a test to see if our model works. We did the same thing for Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson books except for one to use as a test model. This is because Shakespeare and Rick Riordan have very distinct writing styles, with Shakespeare's writing being a product of his time, and Rick Riordan having a much simpler modern style to fit the audience of teenagers. 
For our new text to compare against the sources we used one of Shakespeare's plays and one of Riordan's Percy Jackson books to see if our model could accurately predict if the writing styles are similar. Good for our project, it was able to. Then we used each of our individual WR150 final papers to see if what kind of writing style we had. Sia's writing style was much like riordan's as it was more analytical, whereas Om's was shakespearean, which could mean it was more descriptive, and it is something he can now brag about to his friends. We do think our text classification works to a certain extent as it was able to accurately classify the two test texts we had, however there was definitely room for improvement. For our classification method, comparing the similarity score by using a weighted sum of the scores would definitely give a more accurate prediction, as each attribute we compared will definitely have different weights depending on how often it was used. Moreover, we could have added more attributes that demonstrate distinctive writing styles to give more accurate results. We could also make more of an attempt to perfect the stem method, as there are some anomalies that the function doesn't account for which could affect the similarity scores and therefore the classify function. That being said, we are still very proud of our group project, and the fact that Om can now brag to his friends that he now has evidence that his writing is "Shakespearian".
